## Test Suite Specifications

### Epic Coverage (47 Total Tests)

| Epic | Development Timeline | Test Count | Business Focus |
|------|---------------------|------------|----------------|
| **Epic 1**: Core Framework & Auth | Weeks 1-2 | 10 tests | Authentication, RBAC, Security |
| **Epic 2**: User Management & Documents | Weeks 3-4 | 12 tests | User CRUD, Document Management, AI |
| **Epic 3**: Capital Call & Waterfall | Weeks 5-6 | 20 tests | Financial Operations, Calculations |
| **Epic 4**: Workflow Automation & AI | Weeks 7-8 | 5 tests | Process Automation, Integrations |

## Key Features & Benefits

### ✅ Test-First Development Approach
- **All 47 tests written upfront** before development begins
- **Failing tests serve as executable specifications** for developers
- **Clear acceptance criteria** embedded in every test
- **Business value validation** through real user scenarios

### ✅ Complete Epic Traceability
- **Direct mapping** to [Phase 1 Epics](https://dealsphere-inc.github.io/dealsphere-platform-docs/planning/phase1-epics/)
- **Official test case numbers** (1.1.1, 2.1.3, etc.) from documentation
- **Requirement text integration** in test logging for easy epic-to-test mapping
- **Automated traceability matrix** for coverage validation

### ✅ Multi-Class Testing Environment
- **6 user roles** with different permission levels:
  - Admin (full system access)
  - GP - General Partner (management permissions)
  - LP Class A/B - Limited Partners (class-specific access)
  - Auditor (read-only compliance access)
  - Manager (class-specific management)
- **Class isolation validation** - critical for DealSphere's multi-tenant architecture
- **Cross-class data leakage prevention** testing

### ✅ Comprehensive Business Coverage
- **Authentication & Security** - RBAC, encryption, audit trails
- **Document Management** - Class isolation, versioning, AI processing
- **Financial Operations** - Capital calls, waterfall calculations, distributions
- **Workflow Automation** - Approval systems, AI-assisted features
- **Performance & Security** - Load testing, penetration scenarios

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Development Teams
1. **Follow the failing tests** - they define exactly what to build
2. **Use epic-based development** - work through tests sequentially by epic
3. **Trust test requirements** - they represent official business requirements
4. **Refer to the development guide** for daily workflow

### For QA Teams
1. **Implement test infrastructure** using the technical specification
2. **Create all 47 test scenarios** with proper epic traceability
3. **Use provided templates** for consistent test structure
4. **Generate coverage reports** to track progress

### For Product Teams
1. **Tests validate business requirements** - they ensure correct outcomes
2. **Epic traceability** ensures complete requirement coverage
3. **Use test reports** to track feature delivery against business needs

## Documentation Integration
