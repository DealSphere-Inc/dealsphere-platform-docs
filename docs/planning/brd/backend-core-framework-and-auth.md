# Business Requirements Document (BRD)
## Epic: Core Framework & Auth (Weeks 1–2)

**Document Owner:** Product Manager  
**Stakeholders:** DevOps, Backend, Frontend, Security, QA Teams  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Draft

---

### 1. Executive Summary

The purpose of this initiative is to lay the technical foundation for the DealSphere Platform by delivering a robust core framework and secure authentication system. This core will support all upcoming features and will be essential for scalability, security, and maintainability.

---

### 2. Business Objectives

- Accelerate subsequent feature development by establishing a production-grade development and deployment environment.
- Secure all user data and system access via a modern authentication and authorization framework.
- Ensure the platform’s CI/CD process is automated, reliable, and enforces coding and testing standards.
- Provide high test coverage and automated security validation for all implemented modules.

---

### 3. Scope

#### In Scope

- Setting up and validating repository structure for backend, frontend, and database.
- Implementation of Docker Compose to orchestrate multi-service setup.
- Establishment of a complete CI/CD pipeline with code quality enforcement and automated tests.
- Development of JWT-based authentication (login, logout, password reset, session management).
- Creation of a secure, extensible role-based access control (RBAC) system and role assignment workflows.
- Security hardening including rate limiting, security headers, input validation, and lockout protection.
- Deployment of distinct development and staging environments with all necessary configurations and artifact validations.
- Comprehensive unit, integration, and security testing.

#### Out of Scope

- Non-authenticated user flows (e.g., public pages).
- Non-core business features (e.g., deal management, user profile enhancements).

### 4. Requirements

#### Functional Requirements

| ID           | Requirement                                                    | Priority |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| FR-01        | Repository deploys via Docker Compose on all target hosts      | High     |
| FR-02        | CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) runs automated tests and builds| High     |
| FR-03        | Users can register, validate email, and login/logout securely  | High     |
| FR-04        | System handles password resets and account lockouts            | High     |
| FR-05        | JWT tokens are generated, validated, and refreshed properly    | High     |
| FR-06        | Role assignment (RBAC) and immediate role/permission changes   | High     |
| FR-07        | Each API endpoint and UI element is permission-protected       | High     |
| FR-08        | Automated security and negative/abuse testing is in place      | High     |
| FR-09        | All environments are fully operational and validated           | High     |

#### Non-Functional Requirements

- System must meet or exceed 80% test coverage for all critical user flows.
- Enforce linting and code formatting pre-merge.
- All error messages must avoid leaking sensitive information.
- Security automations should validate against common vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP Top 10).

---

### 5. Acceptance Criteria

- Repository and environments can be spun up via Docker Compose.
- CI/CD pipeline executes all stages (test, build, deploy).
- Minimum 80% test coverage for all code.
- User registration with email validation is verified.
- Successful login/logout and password reset flow with JWTs.
- Failed authentication attempts trigger account lockout rules.
- Role assignment/changes reflect immediately across the system.
- All API endpoints and UI elements are protected by the RBAC system.
- Penetration and negative tests report no critical vulnerabilities.
- Documentation for setup, deployment, and usage is complete.

---

### 6. Success Metrics

- All tasks and acceptance criteria are met and validated through QA.
- 100% functional and security test coverage on authentication and RBAC components.
- Successful deployment to development and staging, with use case test completion.
- No critical security findings in initial scans.
- Complete project documentation is delivered and reviewed.

---

### 7. Dependencies & Risks

- Database schema must be finalized for proper implementation of RBAC and authentication.
- Choice and configuration of JWT tokens will influence all future user/session management features.
- Delays or misconfigurations in environment setup may block the onboarding of parallel teams.
- Security approach taken will set the precedent for all future features—must be carefully validated.

---

### 8. Out of Scope & Exclusions

- User interfaces beyond login/auth and basic RBAC display for the initial phase.
- Business workflows unrelated to core authentication, permissions, or deployment pipeline.

---

### 9. Stakeholder Sign-Off

Stakeholders must review and sign off on:
- Acceptance criteria alignment
- Security control approach
- Deployment and test automation readiness
