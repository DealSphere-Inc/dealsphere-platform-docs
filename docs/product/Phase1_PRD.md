## 1. Product Overview

- Product Name: DealSphere
- Description: Secure, DLT-backed fund management platform for PE/VC with class-specific workflows and automated waterfalls, built on R3 Corda.
- Objective: Deliver an MVP that supports multi-class fund operations (permissions, capital calls, workflows, waterfalls), basic analytics, fund accounting, and portfolio tracking with AI-assisted experiences and a finalized architecture for scale.

---

## 2. Target Users

- General Partners (GP), Limited Partners (LP) by class (A, B, etc.)
- Fund Managers and Administrators
- Auditors and Compliance users
- Investment/Portfolio Analysts
- Investors (read-only class-specific views)
- AI Assistant (virtual role for automated tasks)

---

## 3. Core Use Cases

- Role-based, class-segregated access and views
- Document management with on-ledger metadata, versioning, and audit logs
- Capital call lifecycle per class (rules, notices, tracking)
- Multi-class European and American waterfalls with prioritization and clawbacks
- Class-specific workflow automation (approvals, reminders, escalations)
- Basic analytics by class (committed vs. deployed, portfolio breakdown)
- Fund accounting and NAV/P&L at class and combined levels
- Portfolio tracking with class-based contributions and returns
- AI-assisted class-specific queries and drafting

---

## 4. Feature Requirements (Phase 1)

### 4.1 Platform & Security

- Role-based access control (RBAC) with strict class segregation
- R3 Corda DLT integration for immutable audit trails
- Multi-tenant architecture supporting multiple funds
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Compliance framework (GDPR, SOX, regional requirements)

### 4.2 Document Management

- Upload, version, and categorize documents per class
- On-ledger metadata storage with hash verification
- Access controls ensuring LP class segregation
- Document templates and automated generation
- Full audit logs for document lifecycle events

### 4.3 Capital Calls

- Class-specific capital call rules and thresholds
- Automated notice generation and distribution per class
- Payment tracking and reconciliation by class
- Default management and escalation workflows
- Integration with banking APIs for payment verification

### 4.4 Waterfall Calculations (Multi-Class)

- European and American waterfall models
- Class-based priority and allocation rules
- Clawback provisions and carry calculations
- Real-time distribution modeling and simulation
- Support for preferred returns and catch-up provisions

### 4.5 Workflow Automation (Per Class)

- Class-specific approval workflows
- Automated reminders and escalations
- Task assignment and tracking per class
- SLA monitoring and reporting
- Integration with email and notification systems

### 4.6 Basic Analytics

- Class-based committed vs. deployed capital tracking
- Portfolio performance breakdown by class
- Cash flow projections per class
- Basic reporting and export functionality
- Real-time dashboard views segregated by class

### 4.7 AI Integration (Initial)

- AI-assisted document drafting with class-specific parameters
- Intelligent data extraction from uploaded documents
- Class-aware query processing and responses
- Automated categorization and tagging
- Compliance checking and risk flagging

### 4.8 Architecture Design

- Microservices architecture with API-first approach
- Cloud-native deployment (AWS/Azure/GCP)
- Scalable data architecture supporting multi-class operations
- API gateway for integrations and external services
- Security model for strict class-based segregation and audit

### 4.9 Fund Accounting

- Multi-class general ledger
- NAV and P&L per class and combined

### 4.10 Portfolio Tracking

- Company profiles with investment history split by class
- Performance metrics per class and consolidated views

---

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

- Mobile-responsive web app
- High security: DLT auditability, encryption, RBAC with class segregation
- GDPR-ready and regional compliance placeholders
- Cloud deployment (AWS/Azure/GCP)
- API-first for integrations and modular scale

---

## 6. Acceptance Criteria (Key)

- Permissions: LPs see only their class; adjustable without contract redeploy
- Documents: Versioning works; access logs accurate; hash verification consistent
- Capital Calls: Issued per class rules; LP payment statuses update correctly
- Waterfalls: Distributions per class match test vectors; switching preserves class logic
- Workflows: Class A and B flows run concurrently without conflict; reminders as configured
- Analytics: Reports filterable by class; exports work
- AI: Filters/outputs adhere to class constraints; drafts match class parameters
- Accounting: NAV computed separately by class and combined
- Portfolio: Class-specific contributions and returns displayed

---

## 7. Success Metrics

- Funds onboarded leveraging multi-class features
- Volume of class-specific capital calls and distributions
- Workflow automation throughput and SLA adherence
- Accuracy of waterfall outputs vs. expected vectors
- Frequency of AI-assisted actions
- Analytics/export usage by class

---

## 8. Risks & Mitigation

- Multi-class complexity: Test vectors and simulation harnesses
- Security/segregation: Pen testing, rigorous data access validation, on-ledger audit
- Scope creep: Phased deliveries with strict change control
- Compliance variance: Region placeholders and pilot validation
