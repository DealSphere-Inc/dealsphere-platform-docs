# ADR-0011: Authorization Strategy

**Permalink:** ADR-0011

**Author:** @dealsphere-dev • **Status:** Open • **Date:** 2025-08-13 • **Deciders:** @architecture-team, @security-team, @platform-team • **Technical Story:** [Authorization requirements from Phase 1 PRD](docs/product/Phase1_PRD.md#authorization) • **Tags:** authorization, security, rbac

## Context

The DealSphere platform requires a comprehensive authorization strategy to control access to resources and operations across all microservices. With multiple user roles, complex business rules, and strict data privacy requirements outlined in the [Product Requirements Document](docs/product/Phase1_PRD.md#authorization), we need a unified approach to authorization that integrates seamlessly with our chosen identity provider ([ADR-0010](ADR-0010-identity-provider-and-claims-strategy.md)).

**Key requirements from PRD alignment:**
• [Role-based access control](docs/product/Phase1_PRD.md#rbac) for user types (viewers, bidders, sellers, admins)
• [Principle of least privilege](docs/product/Phase1_PRD.md#least-privilege) enforcement
• Fine-grained permissions for deal management operations
• Audit trail compliance for financial transactions
• Performance requirements for high-frequency API calls

## Decision

For Phase 1, we will adopt Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with policy-based authorization using Spring Security framework with method-level annotations.

## For now

**For now:** Spring Security with @PreAuthorize and @PostAuthorize annotations, JWT claims-based role propagation from identity provider, centralized role definitions with distributed enforcement, and method-level security for fine-grained control.

**Implementation Details:**
• Role Definitions: Four primary roles (VIEWER, BIDDER, SELLER, ADMIN) mapped to JWT claims
• Permission Model: Resource-action patterns (e.g., deal:read, bid:create, user:admin)
• Enforcement Points: Service method annotations with SpEL expressions
• Caching Strategy: Role/permission resolution cached for 15 minutes to optimize performance
• Audit Integration: All authorization decisions logged with request context

**Technology Stack:**
• Spring Security 6.x with method-level security enabled
• JWT token validation with role extraction
• Custom SecurityContext propagation across service boundaries
• Redis-backed permission cache for performance

## Rationale

**Performance:** Authorization decisions must be fast enough for high-frequency trading scenarios without compromising security. Method-level caching with Redis provides sub-millisecond authorization decisions while maintaining security boundaries.

**Scalability:** RBAC model scales efficiently with user growth and role complexity. Distributed enforcement allows each microservice to make independent authorization decisions without central bottlenecks.

**Maintainability:** Declarative annotations reduce boilerplate and make security requirements explicit in code. Spring Security integration provides well-tested patterns and extensive community support.

**Security:** Financial platform requires auditable access controls and clear authorization boundaries for SOX compliance. Multi-tenant architecture needs strict resource isolation to prevent unauthorized access to deal information.

**Cost:** Spring Security integration leverages existing framework investments and reduces development time compared to custom authorization solutions.

## Deferred Alternatives

**Alternative:** Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) with policy engine
**Trigger:** User base exceeds 10,000 active users or business rules become too complex for RBAC
**Timeline:** Sprint 12 evaluation, Sprint 15 implementation if triggered
**Reason for deferral:** ABAC adds significant complexity for Phase 1 requirements. RBAC meets current needs while allowing future migration path.

**Alternative:** OAuth2 scopes-based authorization
**Trigger:** External API partnerships require OAuth2 scope delegation
**Timeline:** Sprint 8 evaluation based on partnership requirements
**Reason for deferral:** Current Phase 1 focuses on internal platform users. OAuth2 scopes add unnecessary complexity for JWT-based internal authorization.

**Alternative:** Custom authorization service
**Trigger:** Authorization performance becomes a bottleneck (>5ms p99) or Spring Security limitations block critical features
**Timeline:** Sprint 10 evaluation, Sprint 12 implementation if needed
**Reason for deferral:** Spring Security provides proven solution with excellent performance characteristics. Custom service adds development and maintenance overhead.

## Rejected Alternatives

**ACL (Access Control Lists):** Rejected due to maintenance complexity and poor scalability with growing user base.

**Session-based authorization:** Rejected due to stateless architecture requirements and microservices distribution challenges.

**Database-driven permissions:** Rejected due to performance concerns and tight coupling between authorization logic and data layer.

## Consequences

**Positive:**
• Mature, well-tested authorization framework with extensive documentation
• Seamless integration with existing Spring Boot microservices
• Method-level annotations provide clear security boundaries
• Strong audit capabilities for regulatory compliance
• Performance optimization through caching layers
• Developer familiarity reduces learning curve

**Negative:**
• Spring Security learning curve for complex SpEL expressions
• Potential performance overhead for high-frequency operations
• Framework lock-in makes future migration more complex
• Limited flexibility compared to custom authorization solutions
• Debugging authorization issues can be challenging

**Mitigation Strategies:**
• Comprehensive Spring Security training for development team
• Performance testing with authorization overhead measurement
• Clear migration path documented for future ABAC transition
• Standardized SpEL expression patterns and code review guidelines
• Enhanced logging and debugging tools for authorization troubleshooting

## Revisit Triggers

• Authorization performance degrades below 2ms p99 threshold
• User base growth exceeds 10,000 active users
• Business rule complexity requires attribute-based decisions
• External API partnerships require OAuth2 scope delegation
• Regulatory requirements change authorization audit needs
• Spring Security framework limitations block critical features

## Target Sprint for Formal Decision

**Implementation Timeline:**
• **Sprint 3:** Core RBAC framework setup and basic role definitions
• **Sprint 4:** Method-level annotations and permission enforcement
• **Sprint 5:** Caching layer and performance optimization
• **Sprint 6:** Audit logging integration and compliance testing

**Decision Point:**
• **Sprint 4:** Formal decision confirmation based on implementation experience
• **Sprint 8:** First major revisit trigger evaluation
• **Sprint 12:** ABAC migration decision point

## Guardrails

**Must:**
• All authorization annotations must include audit logging
• Role definitions must be version-controlled and peer-reviewed
• Security testing must validate both positive and negative authorization cases
• Default deny policy - all endpoints require explicit authorization
• Sensitive operations require dual authorization (role + additional verification)

**Should:**
• Authorization decisions should complete within 2ms p99
• Permission cache should maintain >90% hit ratio
• No more than 3 authorization checks per business operation
• Performance testing should include authorization overhead measurement

**Won't:**
• Role/permission matrix documentation updated with every change
• Authorization configuration changes require security team approval
• Automated testing for all permission combinations
• Weekly authorization audit reports generated
• Emergency role/permission override process documented
• Authorization annotations mandatory for all public methods
• Code review checklist includes authorization verification
• Integration tests must cover authorization edge cases
• Security training required for all developers working on authorization code
