# ADR-0014: Rate Limiting Strategy

**Status:** Open   
**Date:** 2025-08-13   
**Tags:** rate-limiting, api, throttling   

## Context

- To be determined - problem space, constraints, and drivers.  
- Reference product/PRD requirements, delivery phase, and non-functional priorities.  
- Note team expertise, ecosystem maturity, and operational realities.  
- Include links to internal docs when relevant.  

## Decision

To be determined - decision statement in one sentence, active voice, clearly scoping where it applies.

## Rationale

### Why Rate Limiting Strategy (TBD)

- **Pillar 1 (e.g., Stability and Support)**  
  - Supporting detail 1  
  - Supporting detail 2  

- **Pillar 2 (e.g., Ecosystem Readiness)**    
  - Supporting detail 1  
  - Supporting detail 2  

- **Pillar 3 (e.g., Team Proficiency and Velocity)**  
  - Supporting detail 1  
  - Supporting detail 2  

- **Pillar 4 (e.g., Modern Features without migration burden)**
  - Supporting detail 1  
  - Supporting detail 2  

- **Pillar 5 (e.g., Risk Management)**
  - Supporting detail 1  
  - Supporting detail 2  

- **Pillar 6 (e.g., Upgrade Path Considerations)**
  - Supporting detail 1  
  - Supporting detail 2    

### Alternatives Considered

  - …  

- **Mitigation Strategies:**  
  - …  
  - …  

## Revisit Trigger and Target Sprint  

- **Revisit Trigger:**  
  - Condition 1 (e.g., ecosystem certification, measurable benefit)  
  - Condition 2 (e.g., scheduled upgrade window with regression capacity)  

- **Target Sprint:**  
  - Sprint N (or timeframe) for adoption/change  

## Guardrails

- Maintain a compatibility matrix for critical dependencies.  
- Keep build configurations centralized to ease future upgrades.  
- Require performance and regression benchmarks for upgrades.  
- Any additional policy/process controls specific to this decision.
