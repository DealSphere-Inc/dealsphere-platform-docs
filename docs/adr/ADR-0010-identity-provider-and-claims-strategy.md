## Context

What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?

OAuth 2.0 with OpenID Connect provides standardized identity and claims management essential for secure user authentication across microservices architecture. Claims-based identity strategy enables fine-grained access control, user attribute management, and seamless integration with external identity providers. Identity provider selection directly impacts security posture, user experience, and compliance requirements across the DealSphere platform.

PRD alignment: [Identity and access management](../product/Phase1_PRD.md#identity-and-access-management), [security requirements](../product/Phase1_PRD.md#security-requirements), and [compliance](../product/Phase1_PRD.md#compliance) mandate robust identity verification and user attribute management.

## Decision

What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

Adopt OAuth 2.0 with OpenID Connect for identity management, implementing JWT-based claims strategy with support for multiple identity providers and standardized user attribute handling for Phase 1 development.

For now:
• Selected Identity Provider: Keycloak OpenID Connect (OIDC) with JWT tokens for all services during Sprint 1 foundational implementation
• Token Format: JWT tokens with standardized claims structure (sub, aud, iss, exp, iat, roles, permissions)
• Scopes: Standard OpenID Connect scopes (openid, profile, email) plus custom scopes for service-specific access (dealsphere:read, dealsphere:write, dealsphere:admin)
• Integration Pattern: Direct OIDC client integration for each microservice with token validation middleware
• Claims Mapping: Standardized user attributes mapped to JWT claims for consistent RBAC implementation
• Security Configuration:
  • Token expiration: 15-minute access tokens with 24-hour refresh tokens
  • PKCE flow for client applications
  • RS256 signature algorithm with rotating keys
  • Secure token storage using httpOnly cookies for web clients

## Rationale

Why is this the right decision given our architectural pillars?

### Rationale Pillars

#### Why Identity Provider and Claims Strategy (OAuth 2.0 + OpenID Connect)

• Pillar 1 (Stability and Support)
  ◦ OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect provide mature, widely-adopted identity standards
  ◦ JWT token format enables stateless authentication and distributed claims verification

• Pillar 2 (Ecosystem Readiness)
  ◦ Standard scopes and claims reduce integration complexity with external providers
  ◦ Comprehensive security features including PKCE, state parameters, and token validation

• Pillar 3 (Team Proficiency and Velocity)
  ◦ Support for enterprise identity providers (Azure AD, Google Workspace, Okta)
  ◦ Social login integration for consumer-facing features

• Pillar 4 (Modern Features without migration burden)
  ◦ Custom identity provider implementation for internal user management
  ◦ Standardized token exchange and claims mapping across providers

• Pillar 5 (Risk Management)
  ◦ Token-based authentication reducing password security risks
  ◦ Short-lived access tokens with refresh token rotation

• Pillar 6 (Upgrade Path Considerations)
  ◦ Audit trail through standardized token logging and validation
  ◦ Compliance support for data privacy regulations through user attribute control

## Deferred Alternatives

What alternatives are we deferring for future consideration?

Alternative: Enterprise Identity Federation (Beyond Basic OIDC)
• Trigger: When enterprise customer requirements demand advanced federation features
• Timeline: Phase 2 enterprise rollout
• Reason for deferral: Current OIDC implementation meets Phase 1 requirements without additional complexity

Alternative: Multi-Region Identity Synchronization
• Trigger: When geographic distribution requires local identity stores
• Timeline: Global expansion phase
• Reason for deferral: Single region deployment sufficient for initial market validation

#### Rejected Alternatives

What alternatives are we rejecting?

• SAML 2.0: Enterprise-grade federation but XML complexity, less mobile-friendly, limited modern application integration
• Custom Authentication System: Full control but significant development overhead, security risks, compliance challenges
• Session-based Authentication: Simpler implementation but poor scalability across microservices, stateful session management complexity

## Consequences

What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?

Positive:
• Standardized authentication flow across all microservices
• Enhanced security through token-based authentication and short-lived tokens
• Simplified integration with external identity providers
• Fine-grained access control through claims-based authorization
• Improved user experience with single sign-on capabilities
• Compliance-ready user attribute management

Negative:
• Additional infrastructure complexity with Keycloak deployment and management
• Token validation overhead across all service calls
• Potential single point of failure if identity provider becomes unavailable
• Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with OAuth 2.0/OIDC workflows

Mitigation Strategies:
• Implement Keycloak high availability configuration with clustering
• Add comprehensive monitoring and alerting for identity provider health
• Create fallback authentication mechanisms for critical system operations
• Provide team training and documentation for OAuth 2.0/OIDC implementation
• Implement token caching strategies to reduce validation overhead

## Revisit Triggers

• Performance impact from token validation exceeds acceptable thresholds (>50ms per request)
• Enterprise customer requirements demand SAML 2.0 or other federation protocols
• Security audit identifies vulnerabilities in current JWT implementation
• Keycloak operational overhead becomes prohibitive (>20% of infrastructure costs)

## Target Sprint for Formal Decision

• Target Sprint: Sprint 1 for foundational implementation and Sprint 2 for production readiness

## Guardrails

### Must

• All authentication must flow through designated identity provider
• JWT tokens must be validated on every protected endpoint
• Sensitive operations must require fresh token validation
• User permissions must be derived from standardized claims structure

### Should

• Token expiration should follow recommended security practices (15-minute access tokens)
• Claims should follow OpenID Connect standard naming conventions
• Identity provider should be deployed with high availability configuration
• All identity operations should be logged for audit purposes

### Won't

• Direct database user authentication bypassing identity provider
• Long-lived access tokens (>1 hour) for any use case
• Custom token formats outside JWT standard
• Embedded user credentials in application configuration
