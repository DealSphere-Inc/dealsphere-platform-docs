**Author:** @MysterTech  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-08-13  
**Deciders:** @MysterTech  
**Technical Story:** [optional link to ticket/issue]  
**Tags:** dlt, corda, blockchain

## Context
- DealSphere platform requires a distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform for secure, tamper-proof transaction recording and multi-party business process execution.
- R3 Corda 5 provides enterprise-grade DLT capabilities specifically designed for regulated financial services and complex business networks.
- Team expertise includes blockchain development experience, and Corda's JVM-based architecture aligns with existing Java 17 runtime decisions.
- PRD alignment: [Security requirements](../product/Phase1_PRD.md#security-requirements) and [regulatory compliance](../product/Phase1_PRD.md#regulatory-compliance) for financial transactions are prioritized for Phase 1 core flows.

## Decision
Adopt R3 Corda 5 as the distributed ledger technology platform for DealSphere Phase 1.

## Rationale

### Why R3 Corda 5 as DLT Platform?

**Enterprise-Grade Security and Compliance:**
- Built-in privacy features with need-to-know data sharing principles.
- Strong cryptographic foundations and secure communication protocols.
- Regulatory compliance features aligned with financial services requirements.
- Mature audit trails and transaction history capabilities.

**Technical Architecture Alignment:**
- JVM-based platform compatible with Java 17 runtime decision.
- Spring Boot integration capabilities for microservices architecture.
- REST and gRPC API support for seamless service integration.
- Familiar development patterns reducing team onboarding overhead.

**Business Network Capabilities:**
- Multi-party transaction support essential for deal syndication workflows.
- Smart contract (CorDapp) development for complex business logic.
- Identity and certificate management for trusted counterparty networks.
- Pluggable consensus mechanisms for different transaction types.

**Operational Maturity:**
- Production-ready platform with enterprise support options.
- Comprehensive monitoring and observability tools integration.
- Docker containerization support for Phase 1 orchestration strategy.
- Established backup and disaster recovery patterns.

**Risk Management for Phase 1:**
- Proven track record in financial services implementations.
- Active community and R3 support for issue resolution.
- Clear upgrade paths and version compatibility strategies.
- Minimizes experimental technology risk during initial platform delivery.

**Performance Characteristics:**
- Optimized for financial transaction throughput requirements.
- Deterministic finality for transaction settlement scenarios.
- Scalable node architecture supporting network growth.
- Efficient resource utilization in containerized environments.

### Alternatives Considered

**Hyperledger Fabric**
- Pros: Open-source platform with strong enterprise adoption.
- Cons: More complex operational overhead; Go/Node.js ecosystem diverges from JVM stack; less financial services specific features.
- Rejected: Does not align with JVM-based technology stack and financial services focus.

**Ethereum (Enterprise)**
- Pros: Large ecosystem and developer community.
- Cons: Significant development and maintenance overhead; security risks from custom cryptography; delays Phase 1 delivery timeline.
- Rejected: Too high risk and development overhead for Phase 1 timeline.

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- DLT integration enables secure multi-party deal processing with cryptographic transaction integrity.
- Corda's privacy model ensures sensitive deal information is only shared with relevant counterparties.
- JVM-based development stack maintains consistency with Java 17 and microservices architecture decisions.
- Enterprise-grade security and compliance features align with financial services requirements.
- Established development patterns reduce team onboarding overhead.

**Negative:**
- Requires team training on Corda-specific concepts (states, flows, contracts) but leverages existing JVM skills.
- Platform lock-in to R3 ecosystem and potential licensing costs.
- Performance limitations compared to traditional databases for non-DLT operations.
- Additional operational complexity for node management and network coordination.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Maintain abstraction layer between business logic and Corda-specific implementations.
- Establish comprehensive training program for Corda development patterns.
- Implement performance benchmarks and monitoring for transaction throughput.
- Document all CorDapp development patterns and maintain code review standards.

## Revisit Trigger and Target Sprint

- Revisit Triggers:  
  
- Performance bottlenecks emerge that cannot be resolved through configuration or infrastructure scaling.  
  
- Regulatory requirements change significantly requiring features not available in Corda 5.  
  
- Major security vulnerabilities discovered that cannot be patched within acceptable timeframes.

- Target Sprint:  
  
- Sprint 1 (DLT platform foundation established in Phase 1)

## Guardrails

### Must
- Maintain abstraction layer between business logic and Corda-specific implementations to enable future platform migration if needed.
- Establish performance benchmarks and monitoring for transaction throughput and latency.
- Keep Corda version compatibility matrix updated and plan regular security updates.

### Should
- Document all CorDapp development patterns and maintain code review standards for smart contract logic.
- Implement comprehensive testing strategies for Corda flows and contracts.

### Won't
- Allow direct database access bypassing Corda's data model.
- Implement custom cryptographic solutions without R3 approval.
- Deploy CorDapps without proper code review and security assessment.
