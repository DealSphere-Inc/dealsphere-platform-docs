# ADR-0013: Observability Stack

• **Permalink:** https://github.com/DealSphere-Inc/dealsphere-platform/blob/main/docs/adr/ADR-0013-observability-stack.md
• **Author:** @MysterTech
• **Status:** Open
• **Date:** 2025-08-13
• **Deciders:** @MysterTech, @team
• **Technical Story:** [Sprint 1 observability requirements](https://github.com/DealSphere-Inc/dealsphere-platform/blob/main/docs/tech/sprint-1-core-platform.md)
• **Tags:** observability, monitoring, logging

## Context

What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?

The DealSphere platform requires comprehensive observability capabilities to support our microservices architecture across development, staging, and production environments. As outlined in Sprint 1 requirements, we need metrics, logging, and distributed tracing to ensure operational visibility, debugging capabilities, and performance monitoring.

Key drivers include:
- Microservices architecture creating distributed system complexity requiring end-to-end visibility
- Team needs for rapid debugging and incident response in production
- Compliance requirements for audit trails and performance monitoring
- Cost-effective solution that scales with our service growth from 5 to 20+ services
- Integration with existing Docker Compose development workflow and future Kubernetes deployment

The team has mixed experience with observability tools, requiring a balance between powerful features and operational simplicity. Current constraints include limited DevOps resources and preference for open-source solutions to maintain cost control during early platform phases.

Environment scope covers development (Docker Compose), staging, and production environments. Platform dependencies include integration with existing Java 17 microservices, gRPC inter-service communication, and PostgreSQL databases.

## Decision

What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

We adopt a unified observability stack based on the Grafana ecosystem (Prometheus, Loki, Tempo, Grafana) for metrics, logs, and distributed tracing across all DealSphere platform services.

**For now:**
• Metrics: Prometheus + Grafana for metrics collection, storage, and visualization
• Logs: Loki + Promtail for log aggregation and querying
• Traces: Tempo for distributed tracing
• Structured Logging: Standardized JSON logs across all services
• Metrics Endpoints: Basic /metrics endpoint required on all services as per Sprint 1 alignment
• Implementation scope limited to core platform services (5-8 services) for Sprint 1-3

## Rationale

Why is this the right decision given our architectural pillars?

### **Rationale Pillars**

#### **Why Grafana Ecosystem (Observability Stack)**

• **Pillar 1: Cost Control**
  ◦ Open-source stack minimizes licensing costs during platform growth phase
  ◦ Self-hosted deployment avoids per-metric or per-GB pricing models of SaaS solutions
  ◦ Horizontal scaling capabilities support cost-effective growth from 5 to 20+ services

• **Pillar 2: Operational Simplicity**
  ◦ Unified Grafana ecosystem reduces tooling complexity and learning curve
  ◦ Common query language (LogQL/PromQL) across metrics and logs
  ◦ Single pane of glass for all observability data

• **Pillar 3: Team Proficiency and Velocity**
  ◦ Prometheus metrics widely adopted in Java/Spring ecosystem
  ◦ Rich integration with existing microservices patterns
  ◦ Extensive community documentation and examples

• **Pillar 4: Modern Features without migration burden**
  ◦ Native support for distributed tracing with correlation IDs
  ◦ Advanced querying capabilities for complex debugging scenarios
  ◦ Built-in alerting and notification capabilities

• **Pillar 5: Risk Management**
  ◦ Mature ecosystem with proven scalability patterns
  ◦ Active community support and regular security updates
  ◦ Clear migration path to managed solutions if needed

• **Pillar 6: Upgrade Path Considerations**
  ◦ Native Kubernetes support ensures smooth transition from Docker Compose
  ◦ Federation capabilities support future multi-cluster deployments
  ◦ Compatible with cloud-native monitoring standards (OpenTelemetry)

## Deferred Alternatives

What alternatives are we deferring for future consideration?

**Alternative:** SaaS Observability Platforms (e.g., Datadog, New Relic)
• **Trigger:** Monthly data ingestion costs exceed $500/month baseline or team scales beyond 10 engineers
• **Timeline:** Sprint 6+ when operational costs and team size justify managed solutions
• **Reason for deferral:** Cost concerns during early platform phases and preference for operational control

**Alternative:** Managed Cloud Services (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor)
• **Trigger:** Cloud vendor strategy locked in or multi-cloud requirements eliminated
• **Timeline:** Architecture review in Sprint 8+ when deployment patterns are established
• **Reason for deferral:** Maintain cloud vendor neutrality and avoid lock-in during platform development

**Alternative:** Commercial APM Solutions (e.g., AppDynamics, Dynatrace)
• **Trigger:** Enterprise requirements or advanced application performance insights needed
• **Timeline:** When advanced analytics requirements exceed open-source capabilities
• **Reason for deferral:** Licensing costs and operational complexity not justified for current needs

#### **Rejected Alternatives**

• **ELK Stack:** Rejected due to Elasticsearch resource requirements and operational complexity for small team
• **Jaeger Standalone:** Rejected in favor of unified Tempo integration with Grafana ecosystem

## Consequences

What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?

**Positive:**
• Comprehensive observability across all platform services
• Standardized metrics and logging patterns enable consistent debugging approach
• Cost-effective scaling from development to production environments
• Rich alerting and dashboard capabilities support proactive monitoring
• Integration with existing CI/CD and deployment workflows

**Negative:**
• Initial setup complexity requiring DevOps investment in Sprint 1-2
• Self-managed infrastructure overhead for maintenance and updates
• Limited advanced analytics compared to commercial APM solutions
• Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with Prometheus/Grafana ecosystem

**Mitigation Strategies:**
• Create runbooks and automation for common operational tasks
• Plan for dedicated DevOps capacity allocation in Sprint 2-3
• Implement sampling strategies for distributed tracing to manage overhead

## Revisit Triggers

• Monthly data ingestion costs exceed $500/month baseline
• Query performance degradation impacting developer productivity (>30s dashboard load times)
• Storage requirements exceed 100GB/month for logs and metrics combined
• Incident response times average >15 minutes due to tooling limitations
• Team velocity decreases due to observability stack operational overhead
• Production service count reaches 15+ services requiring advanced federation features
• Team size exceeds 10 engineers requiring advanced collaboration features
• Compliance requirements demand enterprise-grade audit and retention capabilities

## Target Sprint for Formal Decision

Sprint 6 (when production monitoring and alerting are fully established and we have 3 months of operational data)

## Guardrails

### **Must**
• All services MUST expose /metrics endpoint in Prometheus format
• All logs MUST be structured JSON with standardized field names
• No secrets or PII MUST appear in logs or metrics
• Critical service health metrics MUST be available with <5 minute SLA
• All distributed traces MUST include correlation IDs for request tracking

### **Should**
• Services SHOULD implement custom business metrics relevant to their domain
• Log retention SHOULD follow data classification policies (30 days development, 90 days production)
• Dashboards SHOULD follow standardized naming and tagging conventions
• Alerting rules SHOULD include runbook links and escalation procedures
• Distributed tracing SHOULD cover end-to-end request flows across service boundaries

### **Won't**
• System will NOT collect or store personally identifiable information in observability data
• Observability stack will NOT be used for application data storage or business logic
• Real-time alerting will NOT replace proper error handling and circuit breaker patterns
