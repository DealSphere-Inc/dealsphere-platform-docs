# ADR-0009: Schema Migration Strategy

**Author:** TBD | **Status:** Open | **Date:** 2025-08-13 | **Deciders:** TBD | **Technical Story:** TBD | **Tags:** migrations, flyway, database

## Context

- Flyway provides mature database schema versioning and migration capabilities essential for maintaining data integrity across deployments and environments.
- Database schema evolution requires systematic version control, rollback capabilities, and coordinated deployment across microservices architecture.
- Schema migration strategy directly impacts deployment reliability, data consistency, and team development workflows across the microservices platform.
- PRD alignment: [Migration strategy](../product/Phase1_PRD.md#migration-strategy) and [release management](../product/Phase1_PRD.md#release-management) require coordinated schema deployments with zero-downtime capabilities.

## Decision

Adopt Flyway for database schema migrations with service-specific migration repositories, coordinated deployment pipelines, and automated rollback capabilities for Phase 1 development.

**For now:**
- Service-Level Migrations: Each microservice manages its own migration files in `src/main/resources/db/migration/`
- Docker Integration: Flyway migrations executed during container startup via Spring Boot auto-configuration
- Local Development: Docker Compose health checks ensure migrations complete before service dependencies start
- Migration Naming: Standard Flyway convention `V{version}__{description}.sql` (e.g., `V1__create_users_table.sql`)
- Rollback Strategy: Manual rollback scripts for critical issues, automated rollback capabilities deferred
- No cross-service migration coordination initially
- Limited to SQL-based migrations (Java migrations deferred)
- Single environment promotion workflow (dev â†’ prod)
- Basic validation and checksum verification only

## Rationale Pillars

**Technical Foundation:**
- Flyway provides mature, battle-tested database migration capabilities with extensive community support
- Service-specific migration repositories align with microservices architecture principles
- Spring Boot auto-configuration reduces implementation complexity for Sprint 1 timeline

**Development Velocity:**
- Standard Flyway conventions minimize learning curve for development team
- Docker integration provides consistent migration execution across environments
- Simplified approach enables immediate Sprint 1-2 implementation without blocking dependencies

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Manual rollback scripts provide safety net for critical production issues
- Checksum verification ensures migration integrity across deployments
- Service-level isolation prevents cascading migration failures across microservices

## Deferred Alternatives

**Trigger:** Sprint 3-4 review based on operational experience
**Timeline:** 4-6 weeks post Sprint 1 completion
**Reason for deferral:** Sprint velocity and complexity management

**Liquibase:**
- XML/YAML-based approach adds complexity for current sprint velocity requirements
- Advanced features not immediately needed for Phase 1 development

**Advanced Flyway Features:**
- Cross-service coordination capabilities
- Java-based migrations for complex transformations
- Advanced rollback and validation features

**Native Database Tools:**
- Would require custom tooling development, conflicting with Sprint 1 timeline
- Lacks standardization across different database engines

### Rejected Alternatives

**Application-Level Migrations:**
- Spring Boot/JPA auto-DDL approaches lack production-grade control
- Cannot provide reliable rollback capabilities
- Insufficient for complex schema evolution requirements

## Consequences

### Positive
- Immediate implementation capability within Sprint 1-2 timeline
- Proven, mature migration technology reduces implementation risk
- Service isolation prevents cross-service migration dependencies
- Docker integration provides consistent execution environment
- Standard naming conventions improve team collaboration

### Negative
- Limited cross-service coordination capabilities initially
- Manual rollback processes increase operational overhead
- Single environment promotion may limit deployment flexibility
- Deferred Java migration capabilities may require future refactoring

### Mitigation Strategies
- Document migration dependencies between services for future coordination planning
- Establish rollback script templates and procedures for consistent manual processes
- Plan Sprint 3-4 review to evaluate cross-service coordination requirements
- Monitor migration execution times to identify performance bottlenecks early

## Revisit Triggers

- Performance Issues: Migration execution time exceeds acceptable deployment windows
- Coordination Failures: Cross-service schema dependencies cause deployment blocking
- Complexity Growth: Migration scripts become difficult to manage or validate
- Team Feedback: Development workflow friction increases beyond acceptable levels
- Production Incidents: Schema-related issues impact system availability

## Target Sprint for Formal Decision

Primary Review: Sprint 3-4 (after basic microservices are operational)

Secondary Review: Sprint 8 (after initial production deployment experience)

The Sprint 3-4 review will focus on adding cross-service coordination and advanced validation. The Sprint 8 review will evaluate the full production experience and consider more sophisticated alternatives.

## Guardrails

### Must
- All migration files must follow standard Flyway naming convention `V{version}__{description}.sql`
- Migration checksums must be validated before deployment to any environment
- Each service must maintain its own migration repository within service codebase
- Manual rollback scripts must be prepared for all structural schema changes

### Should
- Migration execution should complete within 30 seconds for local development
- Migration scripts should include descriptive comments for complex transformations
- Service startup should fail fast if migration validation fails
- Migration history should be preserved in version control with clear commit messages

### Won't
- Won't implement cross-service migration coordination in Sprint 1-2
- Won't support Java-based migrations initially
- Won't implement automated rollback capabilities in Phase 1
- Won't support multiple environment promotion workflows initially
