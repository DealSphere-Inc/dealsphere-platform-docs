# ADR-0002: Microservices Architecture

**Author:** @MysterTech  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-08-13  
**Deciders:** @MysterTech  
**Technical Story:** [optional link to ticket/issue]  
**Tags:** architecture, microservices  

## Context

- Monolithic codebase can’t scale only hot paths (user mgmt, deals, documents, DLT), causing cost and performance issues during spikes.
- Shared deployments/release trains slow teams, increase coordination, and block independent delivery.
- Changes in one area ripple across the system, raising regression risk and elongating test cycles.
- Lowest-common-denominator tech constraints limit best-fit choices (e.g., DLT), while coarse observability/security hinder fault isolation and compliance boundaries.
- Move to microservices to align services to capabilities, enable independent deploy/scale, and reduce cross-team coupling—supporting reliability, maintainability, and autonomy.

## Decision

Adopt a microservices architecture for the DealSphere platform, organizing the system around business capabilities with defined service boundaries including User Service, Deal Service, Document Service, DLT Service, Notification Service, Search Service, and API Gateway.

## Rationale

### Why Microservices Architecture?

**Scalability and Performance:**
- Independent scaling based on individual service demand patterns, particularly important for varying loads across user management, deal processing, and DLT operations.
- Fault isolation prevents service failures from cascading across the entire system.
- Optimized resource allocation per service based on specific performance characteristics.

**Team Autonomy and Development Velocity:**
- Clear service ownership enables independent development cycles aligned with business capabilities.
- Teams can choose optimal technology stacks per service, especially critical for DLT integration requirements.
- Deployment independence allows faster, more frequent, lower-risk deployments.
- Reduces coordination overhead between teams working on different business areas.

**Architectural Flexibility:**
- Service boundaries match business capabilities (user management, deal lifecycle, document handling, DLT operations).
- Technology diversity enables choosing optimal solutions per service (Java for core services, specialized tools for DLT).
- API-driven communication (gRPC internal, GraphQL external) provides clear contract boundaries.
- Independent versioning and evolution of service components.

**Maintenance and Operations:**
- Smaller codebases per service improve maintainability and debugging.
- Service-specific monitoring and observability patterns.
- Granular security and access control at service boundaries.
- Easier compliance and audit trails per business capability.

**Business Alignment for Phase 1:**
- Service organization directly maps to DealSphere business workflows and team structure.
- Enables parallel development of core platform capabilities.
- Supports future platform evolution without architectural rewrites.
- Risk mitigation through service isolation during Phase 1 delivery.

### Alternatives Considered

**Monolithic Architecture**
- Pros:
  - Simpler initial development and deployment
  - Lower operational complexity
  - Easier debugging and testing in early stages
  - Single codebase reduces coordination overhead initially
- Cons:
  - Limited scalability options (scale entire application)
  - Technology constraints across all features
  - Deployment risks affect entire system
  - Team coupling increases as codebase grows
- Rejected: Does not address core scalability, team autonomy, and technology diversity requirements for DealSphere's varied business capabilities.

**Modular Monolith**
- Pros:
  - Better code organization than pure monolith
  - Maintains single deployment model
  - Clear module boundaries
  - Easier refactoring to microservices later
- Cons:
  - Still shares deployment fate and scaling constraints
  - Technology stack limitations persist
  - Module boundaries can erode over time
  - Limited operational isolation
- Rejected: Insufficient for independent scaling needs and team autonomy goals, particularly for DLT integration requirements.

**Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**
- Pros:
  - Service-based architecture approach
  - Protocol standardization (typically SOAP/XML)
  - Enterprise service bus for communication
  - Mature governance models
- Cons:
  - Heavyweight protocols and communication overhead
  - Complex ESB infrastructure requirements
  - Slower development cycles
  - Over-engineering for our platform scale
- Rejected: Too heavyweight for Phase 1 needs and doesn't align with modern development practices and tooling preferences.

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Team autonomy with clear service ownership and independent development cycles
- Fault isolation prevents service failures from cascading across the system
- Deployment independence allows faster, more frequent, lower-risk deployments
- Business alignment with service boundaries matching business capabilities

**Negative:**
- Operational complexity in managing multiple services and their interactions
- Network latency and potential performance overhead from inter-service communication
- Data consistency challenges across service boundaries
- Development overhead from distributed system complexity
- Distributed debugging complexity across multiple services

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Comprehensive observability with logging, metrics, and distributed tracing
- Service mesh for managing inter-service communication
- Clear API contracts with well-defined, versioned interfaces
- Circuit breakers and retry policies for reliability
- Shared libraries for common functionality
- Deployment automation to reduce operational overhead

## Revisit Trigger and Target Sprint

**Revisit Triggers:**

- Revisit Trigger:
  - Performance issues with inter-service communication becoming a significant bottleneck
  - Operational overhead outweighing the benefits of service independence
  - Team structure changes no longer aligning with service boundaries
-Target Sprint:
  - Sprint 1 (architectural foundation established)

## Guardrails

### Must
- API contracts: All inter-service communication must use well-defined, versioned APIs
- Data ownership: Each service must own its data - no shared databases between services
- Monitoring: All services must implement standard observability patterns

### Should
- Service size: Services should be small enough for a single team to own but large enough to provide business value
- Independence: Services should be deployable and testable independently

### Won't
- Allow shared databases between services
- Implement synchronous communication patterns that create tight coupling
- Deploy services without proper monitoring and observability
