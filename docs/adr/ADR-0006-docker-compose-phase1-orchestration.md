**Author:** @MysterTech     
**Status:** Accepted      
**Date:** 2025-08-13      
**Deciders:** @MysterTech    
**Technical Story:**      
**Tags:** orchestration, docker, compose    

## Context

- DealSphere Phase 1 requires local development and integration testing environments that closely mirror production service topology.
- Docker Compose provides container orchestration capabilities suitable for multi-service development environments and CI/CD workflows.
- Team familiarity with containerization patterns and Docker ecosystem tools supports rapid adoption and troubleshooting.
- PRD alignment: [Development workflow](https://github.com/DealSphere-Inc/dealsphere-platform-docs/blob/main/docs/product/prd.md#development-workflow) and [deployment strategy](https://github.com/DealSphere-Inc/dealsphere-platform-docs/blob/main/docs/product/prd.md#deployment-strategy) are prioritized for Phase 1 delivery timelines.

## Decision

Adopt Docker Compose as the container orchestration platform for DealSphere Phase 1 local development, testing, and CI/CD environments.

## Rationale

### Why Docker Compose for Phase 1 Orchestration?

**Development Environment Consistency**
    - Standardized service configuration across all developer workstations.
    - Reproducible dependency management for databases, message brokers, and external service mocks.
    - Version-controlled environment definitions ensuring team alignment.
    - Simple service lifecycle management (start/stop/restart) for rapid iteration.

**Integration Testing Support**
    - Multi-container test suites with predictable service startup ordering.
    - Network isolation and service-to-service communication testing.
    - Database and external service state management for test scenarios.
    - CI/CD pipeline integration with consistent environment provisioning.

**Operational Simplicity**
    - Single-file service definitions (`docker-compose.yml`) for easy maintenance.
    - Built-in service discovery and DNS resolution between containers.
    - Volume mounting for development hot-reloading and persistent data.
    - Log aggregation and debugging tools compatible with Docker ecosystem.

**Resource Management**
    - Efficient resource utilization on developer machines compared to VM-based alternatives.
    - Fine-grained resource allocation per service (CPU/memory limits).
    - Automatic cleanup and container lifecycle management.
    - Minimal infrastructure overhead for local development workflows.

**Technology Stack Alignment**
    - Native Docker image support for Java 17 services and Spring Boot applications.
    - PostgreSQL, Redis, and other backing service containers readily available.
    - Corda node containerization patterns established in community.
    - GraphQL and gRPC service containerization well-documented.

**CI/CD Integration**
    - GitHub Actions and other CI systems provide built-in Docker Compose support.
    - Consistent environment definitions between local development and automated testing.
    - Parallel service builds and testing capabilities.
    - Easy integration with container registries for artifact management.

### Deferred Alternatives

**Kubernetes (Minikube/Kind)**
    - Pros: Production-like orchestration capabilities and advanced networking features.
    - Cons: Significantly higher complexity for Phase 1 scope; resource overhead; learning curve.

### Rejected Alternatives

**VM-based Development**
    - Pros: Complete isolation and familiar virtualization patterns.
    - Cons: Higher resource consumption; slower startup; complex dependency management.

**Manual Service Management**
    - Pros: Direct control over configuration and debugging.
    - Cons: Inconsistent environments; complex coordination; difficult integration testing.

## Consequences

- **Positive:**
    - Standardized environments reduce "works on my machine" issues and improve team productivity.
    - Multi-service integration testing is reliable and reproducible.
    - Container-based architecture provides a foundation for future Kubernetes migration.
- **Negative:**
    - Requires all team members to have Docker knowledge.
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Provide comprehensive Docker/containerization training.
    - Create detailed documentation for common workflows/troubleshooting.
    - Establish service configuration/resource allocation guidelines.

## Revisit Trigger and Target Sprint

- **Revisit Trigger:**
    - Service scaling needs exceed single-machine capabilities.
    - Production needs require advanced orchestration (service mesh, networking, etc.).
    - Team size growth complicates coordination.
- **Target Sprint:**
    - Sprint 1 (orchestration foundation established for Phase 1).

## Guardrails

- Maintain environment parity between Docker Compose configurations and production deployment.
- Document service interdependencies and startup ordering in compose files.
- Set resource limits and health checks for all services.
- Keep configurations version-controlled and synchronized.
