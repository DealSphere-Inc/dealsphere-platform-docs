# ADR-0008: Database Selection

• **Author:** @author
• **Status:** Proposed  
• **Date:** 2025-08-14
• **Deciders:** @name1, @name2, @name3
• **Technical Story:** [optional link to ticket/issue]
• **Tags:** [database, postgresql, microservices, persistence]

## Context

What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?

[Need to select a primary database solution for the DealSphere platform that supports microservices architecture, ACID transactions for financial operations, and team expertise while maintaining operational excellence.]

## Decision

What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

[We are standardizing on PostgreSQL as the primary database solution for all microservices in the DealSphere platform.]

**For now:**
• PostgreSQL instance per microservice for data isolation and independent scaling
• Leverage existing team PostgreSQL expertise for faster development velocity
• Focus on ACID transaction guarantees to support financial operation requirements

## Rationale

Why is this the right decision given our architectural pillars?

### Rationale Pillars

#### Why PostgreSQL (Database Selection)

• **Stability and Support**
  ◦ Mature, battle-tested database with proven track record in enterprise environments
  ◦ Strong community support and extensive documentation
  ◦ ACID compliance ensuring data integrity for financial operations

• **Ecosystem Readiness**  
  ◦ Rich ecosystem of tools, extensions, and third-party integrations
  ◦ Excellent ORM and framework support (Spring Data JPA, Hibernate)
  ◦ Comprehensive monitoring and diagnostics tooling
  
• **Team Proficiency and Velocity**
  ◦ Existing team expertise with PostgreSQL reduces learning curve
  ◦ Familiar toolchain accelerates development and deployment
  ◦ Established patterns for backup, recovery, and maintenance
  
• **Modern Features without Migration Burden**
  ◦ Advanced data types (JSON, arrays, custom types) supporting modern application patterns
  ◦ Full-text search capabilities reducing need for additional search infrastructure
  ◦ Extensible architecture allowing future enhancements
  
• **Risk Management**
  ◦ Open source reduces vendor lock-in risks
  ◦ Multiple cloud provider support ensures deployment flexibility  
  ◦ Well-established backup and disaster recovery patterns
  
• **Upgrade Path Considerations**
  ◦ Clear upgrade paths and backward compatibility
  ◦ Database abstraction layers can ease potential future migrations
  ◦ Strong security features including row-level security

## Deferred Alternatives

What alternatives are we deferring for future consideration?

**Alternative:** MongoDB
• **Trigger:** Document-heavy workloads or need for flexible schema evolution
• **Timeline:** Sprint 6+ when document storage patterns emerge
• **Reason for deferral:** Current relational data model fits well with PostgreSQL; team has limited NoSQL experience

**Alternative:** Amazon Aurora/RDS
• **Trigger:** Operational complexity of self-managed databases becomes prohibitive
• **Timeline:** Phase 2 when moving to production-grade infrastructure
• **Reason for deferral:** Phase 1 focuses on rapid development; managed services can be evaluated later

#### Rejected Alternatives

What alternatives are we rejecting?

• **MySQL:** Limited advanced data types, weaker consistency guarantees, less suitable for complex queries
• **In-memory databases (Redis as primary):** Lack of ACID guarantees and persistence requirements for financial data

## Consequences

What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?

**Positive:**
• Consistent data persistence layer across all microservices
• ACID transaction guarantees supporting financial operation requirements  
• Leveraged existing team PostgreSQL expertise for faster development
• Database instance per service supporting independent scaling and deployment
• Rich querying capabilities supporting complex business logic
• Strong security features including row-level security

**Negative:**
• Additional operational complexity managing multiple PostgreSQL instances
• Potential performance limitations for specialized workloads (time-series, graph data)
• Resource overhead from multiple database instances
• Initial setup complexity for database-per-service pattern

**Mitigation Strategies:**
• Implement database abstraction layers to ease potential migrations
• Establish performance baselines and monitoring for each database instance
• Document service-specific database requirements and scaling characteristics
• Use containerization and automation to reduce operational overhead

## Revisit Triggers

• Performance requirements exceed PostgreSQL capabilities for specific services
• Specialized data patterns (e.g., time-series, graph) require purpose-built databases
• Operational complexity of managing multiple PostgreSQL instances becomes prohibitive
• Cost analysis shows significant savings with managed database services

## Target Sprint for Formal Decision

• **Target Sprint:** Sprint 4 (formal decision after initial business logic and integration testing)

## Guardrails

### Must
• Implement database access through abstraction layers to ease potential migrations
• All schema changes performed through migration tools (e.g., Flyway)
• Configuration and connection info must be managed via secrets manager (not in source code or env vars)
• Use strict role-based access for application and migration credentials

### Should  
• Standardize database schema migration patterns across services
• Establish performance baselines and monitoring for each database instance
• Document service-specific database requirements and scaling characteristics
• Implement connection pooling and resource management best practices

### Won't
• No use of proprietary PostgreSQL extensions that would hinder portability or cloud compatibility
• No direct database access from frontend applications
• No storing of application secrets or configuration in database
