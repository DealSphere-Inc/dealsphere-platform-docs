# DealSphere Platform Documentation
Welcome to the official docs for the DealSphere platform. This documentation is the single source of truth for all architecture decisions, technical implementation details, product requirements, QA/test coverage, and delivery planning.

## ðŸ“š Documentation Structure
- **[Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)](./adr)**
    - Trace all critical technology and architecture decisions.
    - Find each ADR and the ADR Master Index for rationale/history.
- **[Planning](./planning)**
    - Contains weekly epics table ([phase1-epics.md](./planning/phase1-epics.md)), delivery plans, phase breakdowns, and milestone maps.
    - **[BRD Repository](./planning/brd)** - Business Requirements Documents
    - **[Tech Spec Repository](./planning/tech-spec)** - Technical Specifications
- **[Product](./product)**
    - Contains Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) and feature specs, versioned per release.
- **[QA & Compliance](./qa)**
    - End-to-end acceptance criteria, functional test cases, traceability matrix, and compliance documentation.
- **[Technical Documentation](./tech)**
    - Implementation plans, technology landscape overviews, demo/release guides, and the release process.
