## ðŸš€ Quick Start Deployment

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone and start the development environment
git clone https://github.com/DealSphere-Inc/dealsphere-platform.git
cd dealsphere-platform
docker-compose up -d
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Using Docker Compose
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

# Using Kubernetes
helm install dealsphere ./charts/dealsphere -f values.prod.yaml
```

### Monitoring Stack
```bash
# Start comprehensive monitoring
cd monitoring
docker-compose -f docker-compose.monitoring.yml up -d

# Access dashboards
open http://localhost:3000  # Grafana (admin/admin123)
open http://localhost:9090  # Prometheus
open http://localhost:16686 # Jaeger
```
