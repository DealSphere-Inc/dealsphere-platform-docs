# Phase 1 Technical Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the technical implementation plan for Phase 1 of the DealSphere platform, organized into five sprints over 12 weeks with clear deliverables, architectural decisions, and a comprehensive roadmap toward MVP completion. Phase 1 establishes core platform infrastructure, authentication framework, capital calls module foundation, document management, and basic user interface components.
