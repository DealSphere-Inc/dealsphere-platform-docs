# Sprint Demo Checklists

## Purpose
This document provides structured checklists for sprint demos to ensure alignment with Product Requirements Document (PRD) acceptance criteria and comprehensive feature validation.

## Pre-Demo Checklist

### Technical Preparation
- [ ] All demo features are deployed and functional in the demo environment
- [ ] Demo data is prepared and represents realistic use cases
- [ ] Backup plans are ready for any potential technical issues
- [ ] Screen sharing and presentation setup tested
- [ ] All team members have access to demo environment

### Feature Validation
- [ ] Each demo feature maps to specific PRD acceptance criteria
- [ ] User flows have been tested end-to-end
- [ ] Edge cases and error scenarios have been considered
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet acceptance criteria
- [ ] Security requirements are validated

### Documentation
- [ ] Demo script prepared with clear talking points
- [ ] Feature documentation is up-to-date
- [ ] Known issues and limitations are documented
- [ ] Next sprint priorities are identified

## During Demo Checklist

### Presentation Flow
- [ ] Start with sprint objectives and PRD alignment
- [ ] Demonstrate each feature against its acceptance criteria
- [ ] Show user journey from start to finish
- [ ] Highlight technical achievements and challenges overcome
- [ ] Present metrics and performance improvements

### Stakeholder Engagement
- [ ] Collect feedback on each demonstrated feature
- [ ] Document questions and concerns raised
- [ ] Validate that acceptance criteria are met from stakeholder perspective
- [ ] Gather input on user experience and usability

## Post-Demo Checklist

### Immediate Actions
- [ ] Document all feedback and action items
- [ ] Update PRD based on stakeholder input
- [ ] Identify any gaps between demo and acceptance criteria
- [ ] Plan remediation for any unmet criteria

### Sprint Retrospective
- [ ] Assess demo effectiveness and presentation quality
- [ ] Review alignment between delivered features and PRD
- [ ] Document lessons learned for future demos
- [ ] Update demo process based on feedback

### Planning for Next Sprint
- [ ] Prioritize feedback items for next sprint
- [ ] Update acceptance criteria based on demo insights
- [ ] Plan demo improvements for subsequent sprints
- [ ] Communicate outcomes to broader team

## Feature-Specific Acceptance Criteria Validation

### For Each Demonstrated Feature
- [ ] **Functional Requirements**: Does the feature work as specified in PRD?
- [ ] **Performance Requirements**: Does the feature meet performance benchmarks?
- [ ] **User Experience**: Does the feature provide intuitive user experience?
- [ ] **Integration**: Does the feature integrate properly with existing systems?
- [ ] **Security**: Are security requirements properly implemented?
- [ ] **Scalability**: Can the feature handle expected load and growth?

## Success Metrics

### Demo Quality Indicators
- All PRD acceptance criteria demonstrated and validated
- Stakeholder satisfaction with feature completeness
- Clear alignment between technical implementation and business requirements
- Actionable feedback collected for continuous improvement

### Process Improvement Metrics
- Time from feature completion to demo readiness
- Number of issues discovered during demo preparation
- Stakeholder engagement level during demos
- Speed of incorporating demo feedback into next sprint

## Notes and Customization

This checklist should be customized for each sprint based on:
- Specific features being demonstrated
- Stakeholder audience and their priorities  
- PRD acceptance criteria for the sprint scope
- Any special requirements or constraints

Remember: The goal is to ensure that every sprint demo effectively validates PRD acceptance criteria and provides clear value demonstration to stakeholders.
